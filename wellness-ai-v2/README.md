### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- [x] Styled-Components design system  
- [x] Monorepo structure with workspaces
- [x] Global styles and theme system
- [x] Server-side rendering configuration
- [x] Existing backend integration

### Phase 2: Core UI Components ✅
- [x] UI primitives (Button, Card, Avatar, Input, Progress)
- [x] Layout system with responsive navigation
- [x] Wellness-specific components (WellnessCard, ClientCard)
- [x] Working dashboard prototype

### Tech Stack Implemented
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Styled-Components (NO Tailwind)
- **State Management:** Zustand + React Query (installed)
- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives (installed)
- **Charts:** Recharts (installed)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (installed)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Start only frontend
npm run dev:web

# Start only backend  
npm run dev:backend
```

### Build
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Build all
npm run build:all
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Theme Structure
- **Colors:** Primary, secondary, accent, text variations
- **Spacing:** Consistent spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)  
- **Typography:** Font sizes, weights with semantic naming
- **Shadows:** Layered shadow system
- **Border Radius:** Consistent radius scale
- **Breakpoints:** Mobile-first responsive design

### Usage Example
```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { theme } from '@/styles/theme';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${theme.colors.primary};
  padding: ${theme.spacing.md} ${theme.spacing.lg};
  border-radius: ${theme.borderRadius.md};
  font-size: ${theme.fontSize.base};
`;
```
