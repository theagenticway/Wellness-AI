## **4\. Backend Logic: AI Agents & Prompts**

The platform's intelligence is driven by a multi-agent system built on Grok 4\. The GMRP serves as the core instruction set for these agents.

### **4.1. Agent Architecture**

* **Wellness Agent (Orchestrator):** The primary agent that interfaces with the user. It coordinates tasks among other agents and ensures a cohesive user experience.  
* **Nutrition Agent (Specialist):** Manages all aspects of diet, supplementation, and IF based on the GMRP.  
* **CBT Agent (Specialist):** Manages mental health interventions and escalations.  
* **Community Agent (Specialist):** Manages social interactions and content moderation.

### **4.2. Detailed Agent Prompts**

**Wellness Agent Prompt:**  
"You are the lead Wellness Agent for the WellnessAI platform. Your primary directive is the GMRP framework.  
\*\*Context:\*\* The user is \[User Profile: Age, Gender, Goals, Health Conditions\]. They are currently in \[GMRP Phase\]. Their latest data shows \[Key Data: Weight, Sleep, Adherence Rate, Mood Log\]. Their professional, \[Professional Name\], has provided the following override: \[Override Instructions, if any\].  
\*\*Task:\*\*  
1\.  \*\*Synthesize:\*\* Analyze all available user data, API inputs (Fitbit, Viome), and professional overrides.  
2\.  \*\*Orchestrate:\*\* Generate a cohesive daily plan for the user.  
3\.  \*\*Delegate:\*\* Send specific instructions to the Nutrition, CBT, and Community agents.  
4\.  \*\*Personalize:\*\* Craft a motivational summary and actionable nudges for the user's dashboard.  
5\.  \*\*Safety Check:\*\* Cross-reference the plan against known contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, eating disorders) and flag any conflicts for professional review.  
\*\*Output Format:\*\* A JSON object containing directives for each sub-agent and the user-facing plan."

**Nutrition Agent Prompt:**  
"You are the GMRP Nutrition Agent.  
\*\*Context:\*\* The Wellness Agent has provided the following directive: \[Directive from Wellness Agent\]. The user's latest data is \[Data: Lab results, hunger logs, adherence feedback\]. The professional override is \[Override Instructions\].  
\*\*Task:\*\*  
1\.  \*\*Implement GMRP Protocol:\*\* Generate a meal plan, supplement list, and IF schedule according to the user's current GMRP phase.  
2\.  \*\*Adapt:\*\* If the user reports high hunger during a fast, adjust the IF schedule (e.g., shorten duration) and notify the Wellness Agent. If a professional has paused IF, adhere strictly to that override.  
3\.  \*\*Execute:\*\* Prepare API calls for Instacart (ingredients) and iHerb (supplements) for user approval.  
\*\*Output Format:\*\* A JSON object with the detailed nutrition plan and API payloads."

**CBT Agent Prompt:**  
"You are the CBT Agent, specializing in GMRP behavioral support.  
\*\*Context:\*\* The Wellness Agent has assigned the following task: \[Directive\]. The user's recent mood log shows \[Mood Data\].  
\*\*Task:\*\*  
1\.  \*\*Deliver Session:\*\* Initiate the appropriate GMRP CBT session (e.g., 'Managing Cravings in Phase 1', 'Navigating Your First Fast in Phase 2').  
2\.  \*\*Monitor & Escalate:\*\* Analyze user responses for keywords indicating high distress or risk. If risk is detected, immediately trigger the escalation protocol: notify the designated professional and the Wellness Agent.  
\*\*Output Format:\*\* A JSON object with the session transcript and a risk assessment score."

### **5.2. Data Flow Diagram (Professional Override)**

1. **Initiation:** Dr. Lena logs into the Professional Dashboard.  
2. **Action:** She navigates to Alex's profile and modifies his IF schedule from "14:10 twice-weekly" to "12:12 once-weekly," adding a note: "Patient reported dizziness."  
3. **Backend:** The frontend sends a GraphQL mutation to the backend.  
4. **Database:** The override is saved in MongoDB with a timestamp and associated with both Dr. Lena's and Alex's profiles.  
5. **Agent Trigger:** The database update triggers a message via RabbitMQ to the Wellness Agent.  
6. **AI Processing:** The Wellness Agent receives the message, re-evaluates Alex's plan with the new override constraint, and generates an updated daily plan.  
7. **Execution:** The Wellness Agent instructs the Nutrition Agent to implement the new 12:12 schedule.  
8. **User Notification:** The updated plan is pushed to Alex's dashboard in real-time, along with a notification: "Your plan has been updated by Dr. Lena."

## **6\. Screens and User Flows**

### **6.1. Key Screens**

* **Member Onboarding:** A multi-page wizard collecting health info, goals, and API permissions.  
* **Member Daily Dashboard:** A single-scroll view with cards for "Today's Workout," "Today's Meals," "Mindfulness Moment," and "CBT Check-in."  
* **Professional Client Roster:** A grid or list view of all clients, with color-coded alerts for adherence or health risks.  
* **Professional Client Detail View:** A tabbed interface showing a client's dashboard, progress charts, data logs, and an "Overrides" panel.

### **6.2. User Flow: Onboarding a New Member**

Start \-\> Create Account \-\> Health Quiz (Multi-page) \-\> Set SMART Goals (AI-assisted) \-\> Connect Wearables/Apps (API Auth) \-\> View Initial Dashboard (GMRP Phase 1 Plan) \-\> End

## **7\. UI/UX Requirements**

### **7.1. Design Philosophy**

* **Aesthetic:** Clean, calming, and motivating. The UI should feel like a serene and supportive space, not a clinical or demanding one. Use soft colors, ample white space, and elegant typography.  
* **Tone of Voice:** Empathetic, encouraging, and clear. All copy, from button labels to AI-generated nudges, should be positive and easy to understand, avoiding jargon.  
* **Data Visualization:** Charts and graphs must be beautiful, simple, and immediately comprehensible. The goal is to empower the user with insights, not overwhelm them with data.

### **7.2. Accessibility**

* **WCAG Compliance:** The platform must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.  
* **Color Contrast:** All text and meaningful UI elements must have sufficient color contrast to be legible for users with low vision.  
* **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be fully navigable and operable using only a keyboard.  
* **Screen Reader Support:** The application must be built with proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to ensure a seamless experience for screen reader users.

### **7.3. Responsiveness & Performance**

* **Device Agnostic:** The UI must be fully responsive and provide an optimal experience on all major devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). No horizontal scrolling is permitted.  
* **Load Times:** The application must be optimized for fast load times. Critical content should render quickly, with secondary elements loading asynchronously.

### **7.4. Interactivity & Engagement**

* **Micro-interactions:** Use subtle animations and transitions to provide visual feedback for user actions (e.g., a checkmark animation when a task is completed).  
* **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal information as the user needs it. For example, a meal card on the dashboard might show a summary, with a click revealing the full recipe and nutritional details.  
* **Gamification (Subtle):** Incorporate elements like streaks for logging daily, badges for achieving milestones (e.g., "First Week of IF\!"), and celebratory animations to encourage consistent engagement.  
* **Haptic Feedback:** On mobile devices, use subtle haptic feedback for key actions like completing a workout or logging a meal to enhance the tactile experience.

### **7.5. Information Hierarchy**

* **Visual Clarity:** Use typography (size, weight) and color to create a clear visual hierarchy. The most important information on any screen should be the most prominent.  
* **Dashboard Focus:** The Member Dashboard must prioritize "today's tasks." Progress charts and historical data should be easily accessible but secondary to the immediate daily plan.  
* **Actionable Elements:** Buttons and links should be clearly identifiable and use action-oriented language (e.g., "Start Workout," "Log My Meal").
